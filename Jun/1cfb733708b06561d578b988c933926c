I&rsquo;m worried about my family. Boss, this thing ... I didn&rsquo;t know it was going to be like this. I thought it was going to be easy.&rdquo; Op &rsquo;n kol s&ecirc; Christopher: &ldquo; Okay, so they didn&rsquo;t ask anything about me? Or if I&rsquo;m involved with any&shy;thing?&rdquo; Siyoni s&ecirc; dan weer in &rsquo;n stadium: &ldquo;Ja, because it&rsquo;s like a murder thing now. It&rsquo;s not like a robbery or something .&rdquo; Christopher s&ecirc; hierop: &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what I said to you. It became kidnapping and a murder instead of making it a robbery outside the house.&rdquo;Christopher gaan verder: &ldquo;I am going to report that you phoned me now.&rdquo;Siyoni s&ecirc; dan: &ldquo;So, you are going to give them my number?&rdquo;Christopher antwoord: &ldquo;Hmm, yes, I have to tell them. They&rsquo;re investigating me. If I lie to them, they&rsquo;re going to take me in.&rdquo; Christopher s&ecirc; dan aan Siyoni dat die ondersoek&shy;beampte pas by sy (Christopher se) huis was en dit is hoekom hy (Christopher) nie aanhoudend met Siyoni kan praat nie.
